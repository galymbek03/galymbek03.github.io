  <h1>Circular Motion in Physics</h1>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Circular motion is the motion of an object around a circle or an arc of a circle. It is one of the fundamental types of motion in physics and has important applications in various fields including astronomy, mechanics, and electromagnetism.</p>
      
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <p>In circular motion, the following key concepts are used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Radius: the distance from the center of the circle to the object moving along it.</li>
        <li>Centripetal Acceleration: the acceleration directed toward the center of the circle, causing a change in the object's velocity direction.</li>
        <li>Period: the time taken for the object to complete one full revolution around the center of the circle.</li>
        <li>Frequency: the inverse of the period, indicating the number of revolutions per unit time.</li>
      </ul>

<h2>Formulas</h2>
      <p>In circular motion, the following key formulas are used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Circumference: C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, r is the radius.</li>
        <li>Velocity: v = ωr, where v is the velocity, ω is the angular velocity, r is the radius.</li>
        <li>Centripetal Acceleration: a = ω²r, where a is the acceleration, ω is the angular velocity, r is the radius.</li>
      </ul>
